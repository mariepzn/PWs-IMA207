# Practical Works – Coherent Imaging, Source Separation, and Remote Sensing

This repository collects three practical works (PWs) carried out in the context of the **Coherent Imaging, Source Separation, and Remote Sensing** course at Telecom Paris.  
Each practical session explores a different aspect of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, hyperspectral imaging, and statistical analysis for remote sensing applications.

## Contents

### PW1 – Introduction to SAR Data and Interferometric Processing
Introduces the properties of SAR images (amplitude and phase) through visualization and interpretation tasks.  
Covers multitemporal analysis, change detection, and interferometric processing, including registration and filtering of interferograms to extract topographic information.

### PW2 – Hyperspectral Imaging and Source Separation
Focuses on hyperspectral unmixing using the Urban dataset.  
Implements near-separable NMF algorithms such as SPA, plain NMF with PALM, and minimum-volume NMF.  
Endmembers and abundances are estimated and compared against ground truth to evaluate algorithm performance.

### PW3 – SAR Statistics and Despeckling
Studies SAR speckle statistics and despeckling methods.  
Includes empirical verification of distributions, computation of Equivalent Number of Looks, and implementation of spatial multi-looking and the Lee filter.  
Results are compared with a deep learning–based denoising approach (SAR2SAR).
